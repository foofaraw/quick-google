### Installation
1. Download installer from [WeTransfer](https://we.tl/t-B28y3lCnH8) or repository setup folder.
2. Run it and follow the wizard.
3. Open the app from Start Menu. 

App will now run at startup and sit in your system tray waiting for hotkey.

Windows Defender SmartScreen will most likely tag the app as a threat, because it's not signed with EV Code Signing Certificate. [According to VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9c97bec3bb5fa35a40081bf9a6b1911e44d1fe26aa80e0ec4639c2dcb4007eb9/detection), you can trust it, but of course use it at your own risk.
